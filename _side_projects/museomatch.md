Concept prototype designed during the Museomix2020 event, a hackathon hosted in "La Chartreuse de Douai" fine art museum in which I took part. During this event, several teams worked on new ideas to highlight the museum's collection thanks to mobile-based systems. Ours, Museomatch, aims at facilitating communication between the outside garden plants and inside's paintings with an association game. It follows the concept of dating applications, but gives information about common points between a given plant and the painting when the association has been found successfully by the visitor. The game is hosted on a Github Pages server through a Ionic web application, developed with the Angular framework.
