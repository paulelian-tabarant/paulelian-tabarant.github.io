title: Development of this website
---

I started engaging in learning a bit more about front-end web development during summer 2018, while taking the opportunity to make my own portfolio webpage. Styling has been done thanks to the Bootstrap framework as well as the Sass stylesheet language.

Sections of the website (Presentation, Experience, Projects and Skills) are stored inside static files (`.yml` for skills, and `Markdown` for others) and inserted inside the main page using `Liquid` templating language and some filters. The website is deployed on Github pages using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com).

`Technologies : Jekyll 3.9, Bootstrap 4, Liquid, Sass, Markdown`
