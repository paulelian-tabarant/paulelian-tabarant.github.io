title: Photos hosting platform
---

Web-based application dedicated to personal pictures storage and sharing. Each user can create his own account, and then create and edit albums. Any user is able to consult an album if its owner has provided him its name and password. This allows fast album sharing between users.

The application is based on a LAMP stack, with a web interface developed thanks to the Angular 9 framework. The source code is available on this [Github repository](https://github.com/paulelian-tabarant/my-browser-photo-frame). You can also use the platform on [this server](http://51.178.136.146/).

`Technologies : Angular 9, Apache HTTP server, MySQL, PHP 7.2`
