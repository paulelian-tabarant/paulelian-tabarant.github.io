A C console program capable of computing operations on integers larger than 64 bits. In order to achieve this, integers are given to the program as string characters to the program, which then stores them as an array of 32 bits integers. In fact, we operate in a 2<sup>32</sup> basis. My group was specifically responsible of this conversion, as well as giving the result back as a string character on the display.<br> More details on the project can be found in [this pdf file](assets/pdf/projet-crypto.pdf).
