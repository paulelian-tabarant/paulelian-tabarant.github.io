First year engineering school project involving 8 fellow students from my promotion. Our idea was to develop a platform dedicated to student parties, enhancing the experience of each participant.

For this purpose, we designed an online platform, accessible from an Android application by participants. The application tracks the user's dancing movements from the accelerometer of his cell phone, and computes a *dance quality* metric thanks to signal processing algorithms based on the detection of a regular tempo.

Another parts consisted in proposing a user interface to respond to polls of the party's DJ, about the next music to be played for example. Participants could also send pictures they had taken during the party to the platform.

At the end, each user was offered a complete recap, with a graph of the evolution of his dance quality throughout the party and all the pictures posted by participants.

I was responsible of the development of the Android client application. Code is available on this [Github repository](https://github.com/paulelian-tabarant/lastnight-app).
