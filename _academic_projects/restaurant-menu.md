title: Interactive restaurant menu
---

A tablet interface showing a restaurant menu and letting customers order their menu easily. Running on Android OS, and based on a Google Firebase database. Connected to a PC client (Qt-based) for the restaurant workers, letting them manage the commands and edit the menu. My personal role was to design and implement the menus interface on tablets.
