Development of a system responsible of prototyping frame animations on wearable LED devices. The ultimate goal is to design animations communicating emotions or feelings, like a shockwave for example, by a meaningful GIF-like animation on a LED matrix. We developped a web application based on React.js in order to design frames. The animation is then transferred via USB to an Arduino UNO chip, connected to the LED device.
