A Python program aiming at detecting and reading characters from plane analog cockpit screens. This would further be used for semantic compression of video records from these screens in order to operate real-time transfer to the ground. Our work was to locate letters or symbols, and output a list of boxes precisely delimiting each symbol. This would be later used by a PhD student's neuronal network responsible of recognizing each character. More details [here](assets/pdf/paf-poster.pdf).
