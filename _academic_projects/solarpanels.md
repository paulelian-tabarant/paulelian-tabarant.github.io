title: Radiation level on solar panels
---

A project involving my whole class group (28 students). The final goal was to create a console C++ program taking all the main solar panel parameters considered in [this document](assets/pdf/projet-solaire_material.pdf), and computing an estimation of the potential solar radiation level on this panel. As a manager, I was responsible of the functional breakdown of the program development, and then dispatching the different parts to the other students.
