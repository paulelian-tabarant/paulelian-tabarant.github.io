title: Setting up a 6LowPAN network
---

An implementation of a CoAP protocol-based network, thanks to the experiments platform [FIT IOT-LAB](https://www.iot-lab.info). This platforms allows to upload C programs on mobile devices and allows to install the Contiki OS among others to control their sensors. I tried to set up a prototype of public works wireless traffic lights. More details [here](assets/pdf/fit-iot-lab.pdf).
