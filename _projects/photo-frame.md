title: Photos hosting platform
---

Apache server with php API, communicating with a mySQL database to retrieve album names and data from user accounts. Access to user accounts is made through an Angular web front-end displaying basic login prompts. The web client also contains pages to edit album names, photos and descriptions as well as a "view mode" in order to just load pictures from an album and let them be displayed automatically.
