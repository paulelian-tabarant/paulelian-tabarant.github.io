Concept prototype set up during the Museomix2020 event, a hackathon hosted in "La Chartreuse de Douai" fine art museum, during which several teams worked on new ideas to highlight the museum's collection thanks to novel devices. Ours, Museomatch, aims at facilitating communication between the outside garden plants and inside's paintings by making an association game. It follows the concept of dating applications, but gives information about common points between a given plant and the painting when the association has been found successfully by the visitor. The game is hosted at a URL through a Ionic web application, used within an Angular framework.
