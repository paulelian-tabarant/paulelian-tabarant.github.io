title: Collision detection system
---

A collision detection feature added in the VAirDraw 3D engine used by the PIRVI team. It is based on state-of-the-art raycasting with acceleration structures ([octree](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octree)).

It was used for projects using pointing interactions to select or move objects in the scene, or for the projection of 3D lines on other objects in order to make annotations on it for example.

You can find more information about this feature on its [corresponding documentation](assets/pdf/colliders.pdf).
