title: 3D models annotation tool
---

A tablet web-based application for the annotation of 3D models. It is intended for clothes designers during prototyping sessions : they can draw on clothes using touch interactions and explain what needs to be done on the current prototypes.

I was responsible of the development of the tablet drawing interface, with basic options (color, lines thickness) and navigation around the model.

`Technologies : Webpack, ThreeJS, JavaScript ES6`
