title: Visualization of 3D hyperbolic spaces
---

A web-based application for the exploration of [hyperbolic spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_space) from inside. The transform from the cartesian to the hyperbolic space is done using vertex shaders.

I was part of a pair with one of my PIRVI colleagues for this project.
