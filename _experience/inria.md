3D Sketching in Virtual Reality. Project proposed by the [IMAGINE](https://team.inria.fr/imagine/) team, about using user sketching data generated inside a VR environment (HTC Vive) in order to compute and render appropriated surfaces from the original sketches.

It implies mesh generation techniques relying on a least-squares approximation of positions and controller orientations, as well as considerations about the initial intent of the user depicted by his gestures. Surface plausibility with respect to human perception of shapes drawn from raw strokes is also a key point for assessing the efficiency of such a solution.
