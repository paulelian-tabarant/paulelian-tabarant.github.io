Pôle Interaction, Réalité Virtuelle et Images, belonging to the CRIStAL lab (CNRS, University of Lille). Part of a team of 7 developers working on 3D interactive projects, mostly using VR devices. The team has a diverse range of public collaborations with researchers, artists, and museums. We develop tailor-made 3D applications such as an exploration tool for ancient graves in VR, an interactive map displaying 3D data visualizations about the city of Lomme or VAirDraw, a drawing application of 3D shapes and curves in Virtual Reality. More details can be found on the [team website](http://cristal.univ-lille.fr/pirvi/pages/presentation/). My main contributions are cited below. 

- Design and integration of a 3D shapes drawing tool based on mesh generation algorithms from my previous internship
- Collision detection system, based on raycasting with acceleration structures ([octree](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octree))
- Generic material renderering from `.mtl` files, using the [Assimp](https://github.com/assimp/assimp) C++ library
- Basic data visualization module, with each element's shape computed directly inside the GPU thanks to geometry shaders
- 3D buildings generation and rendering from [GeoJSON](https://geojson.org/) `Polygon` descriptions, for the project [UrbiViz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uibUiQkgwc)
- Support during Pauline De Chalendar's project presentation at the exhibition [Experimenta 2020](https://www.experimenta.fr/), dedicated to art and science collaborations.
