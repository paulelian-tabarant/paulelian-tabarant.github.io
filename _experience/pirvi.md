Pôle Interaction, Réalité Virtuelle et Images, belonging to the CRIStAL lab (Lille university). Part of a team of 6 developers working on Virtual Reality projects. The team deals with several public collaborations with researchers, artists, and museums. We work closely on defining the right technology for each project and developing tailor-made 3D applications, such as exploration of ancient graves with VR headsets or navigation between different floors of a building, whose model is projected on a table, thanks to hand tracking systems.
