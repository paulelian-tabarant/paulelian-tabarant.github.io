Youâ€™ve probably come to the right place if you are looking for a dedicated developer. I have been working on 3D computer graphics topics for more than two years and am now shifting my interests towards Fullstack web development. I am mainly interested in

- Designing modular and reusable software;
- Automating redundant (or simply boring) tasks;
- Harnessing the power of digital tools to complement human-driven processes;
- Sharing knowledge (through blogging and teaching for example).

Still attached to my roots of a working-class region in South-Eastern France near Saint-Etienne, I am very grateful towards my present situation. The things I enjoy the most about being a developer are probably 

- the diversity of frameworks and languages;
- the huge community maintaining an almost inexhaustible amount of resources to be used and to learn about.
