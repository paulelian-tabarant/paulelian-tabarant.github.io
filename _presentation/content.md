Youâ€™ve probably come to the right place if you are looking for a dedicated developer. I have been working on 3D computer graphics projects for more than two years and am more generally interested in technology for the access to culture, learning, publishing and content visualization.

Still attached to my roots of a working-class region in South-Eastern France near Saint-Etienne, I am very grateful towards my present situation. What drives my daily life as a developer is the diversity of frameworks and languages, as well as the huge community maintaining an almost inexhaustible amount of resources to be used and to learn about. Feel free to message me on my [personal email address](mailto::{{site.email}}) for any additional information you might need.
